        <p>It came out of nowhere. The initiative for this game. I have always been a fan of storymode action games since childhood and I always felt they lacked specific things even though I loved them. I always imagined that if I ever get a chance I would the best game possible under given resources. Now that I actually got the chance to make a game, I thought "Why not? Why not build a game that I always wanted to play". Yes, OfCourse it might not be as good as the one that I had in the mind but it is definitely a start. A start to something big. Also please note that this is not the final product of the game and I will keep working on this till I reach my childhood expectations on a typical storymode action game</p>
